# Medical Image Classification

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for medical image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It compares two approaches: training a custom CNN from scratch and transfer learning with a pretrained model.

## Features
- **Custom CNN**: Built and trained from scratch.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned a pretrained model for medical imaging tasks.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparative analysis of accuracy, speed, and computational cost.
- **Preprocessing & Optimization**: Experimented with various techniques for better performance.

## Resources
- **Code Walkthrough**: [Colab Notebook](https://lnkd.in/es-thhUE)
- **Presentation Slides**: [Slide Deck](https://lnkd.in/e9DeDd8t)

## Why It Matters
- Democratizing diagnostics through AI in medical imaging.
- Balancing model complexity with interpretability.
- Rigorous testing and documentation for real-world deployment.
